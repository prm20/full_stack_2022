note over browser:
the single page app is just
like the previous, however the
difference is a SPA will load
one HTML page, which is manipulated
with JS (DOM manipulated)
end note

browser->server: HTTP GET https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/data.json
server-->browser: grabs JSON code, which is all of the contents

note over browser:
browser only sends one request to the server
which is the post request as JSON data
containing content and date
end note
